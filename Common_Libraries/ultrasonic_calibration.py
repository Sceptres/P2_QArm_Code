# Ultrasonic sensors will come with different calibrations (offsets) depending on when and where
# they are purchased; so, a calibration curve needs to be created for each sensor for accuracy.
# For simplicity, we will use an offset for now.
# Note: The sensors used on Q-Bot RP-105 to RP-115 are were purchased from the some supplier on the
# same day. Therefore, their offsets are the same.
